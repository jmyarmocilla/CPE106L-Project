# Twitter Database Analysis
Project for CPE106L - B1

This project analyzes a twitter database file that focused on the word "**deepfake**". It runs a GUI application in order to see the analysis of the program and does function such as Sort by Retweet and Sort by Favorites.

The database was collected using "twitter-to-sqlite" which can be found [here](https://pypi.org/project/twitter-to-sqlite/#description)

In order to run this, the user must have installed the following tools for python:
- sqlite3
- Tkinter

To run the program, the needed files for download are:
- tweets_Normalized.db for the database file
- read_database.py for connecting to the database file
- TreeLogic.py for initializing a tree inside the GUI to show the database
- GUI.py for running the program and accessing the GUI for the application

And then, to run the GUI application just run the GUI.py in a compiler of your choice.
For Linux/Anaconda, go to the directory where the files are located and input the command:
```
python GUI.py
```
